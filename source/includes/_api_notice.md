# Terms of Service

The following API endpoints are to facilitate presenting and accepting the **Terms of Service**.
Eagle Eye Networks has their own terms of services which will be presented through the [Get Terms of Service for User](#get-terms-of-service-for-user).
Additionally resellers can add their own **Terms of Service** through the [Get Terms of Service for Account](#create-terms-of-service-for-account), which
will then also be presented with Eagle Eye Network's terms.

Resellers can assign their own terms at the master account level or give each sub account custom terms at the sub account level.

The basic work process is as follows:

1. Resellers create their own terms with the [Get Terms of Service for Account](#create-terms-of-service-for-account)
2. Client UI will display terms if not accepted from a [Get Terms of Service for User](#get-terms-of-service-for-user)
3. Client UI will accept the terms from a [Accept Terms of Service for User](#accept-terms-of-service-for-user)

## Get Terms of Service for User

> Request

```shell
curl --cookie "auth_key=[AUTH_KEY] -X GET https://login.eagleeyenetworks.com/g/users/terms?id=[ID]
```

> Response List

```list
[[ u'cafe1866',
  u'example@eagleeyenetworks.com',
  u'Terms And Condtions (2015)',
  u'',
  1,
  14]]
```

This is to push important terms of service such as "Terms and Conditions (2015)".
The client software must call **GET** to see if the user needs to agree to any new terms of service.
If the user has a **is_compliant** of False then the client software should popup a message box containing the terms of service.
It is preferred to have this as a single combined message box.

If the user agrees to the terms then a **PUT** call should be placed containing array all of the notices.
A past due user is subject to suspension of services, and may not be allowed to login.

## Create Terms of Service for Account

Master Accounts (Resellers) may require their own terms of service.
For that case, this api endpoint is to submit the text of the terms of service.

New terms can be submitted with a PUT command, then a GET command can be done to see the state of the terms.
**PUT** will retire **terms of service** of the same title and account.
Notices can be stored in the sub account or the parent account of the user.
Resellers are limited to 5 terms of service titles and each title will only have one active version.

* Only master accounts can **PUT** an account's terms of service
