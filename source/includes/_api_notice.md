# Terms of Service

<!--===================================================================-->
## Overview
<!--===================================================================-->

The following API endpoints facilitate presenting and accepting the Terms of Service. Eagle Eye Networks uses independent Terms of Service which will be presented through [Get Terms of Service for User](#get-terms-of-service-for-user). Additionally resellers can add their own Terms of Service through [Create Terms of Service for Account](#create-terms-of-service-for-account), which will then be presented with Eagle Eye Network's terms

Resellers can assign their own terms at the master account level or give each sub-account custom terms at the sub-account level

The basic workflow is as follows:

  1. Resellers create their own terms with the [Create Terms of Service for Account](#create-terms-of-service-for-account)
  2. Client UI will display terms if not accepted from a [Get Terms of Service for User](#get-terms-of-service-for-user)
  3. Client UI will accept the terms from a [Accept Terms of Service for User](#accept-terms-of-service-for-user)

<!--===================================================================-->
## Get Terms of Service for User
<!--===================================================================-->

This service allows to push important Terms of Service. The client software must call GET to see whether the user needs to agree to any new Terms of Service

If the user has a `'is_compliant=0'`, the client software should popup a message box containing the Terms of Service
<br>(It is preferred to have this as a single combined message box)

If the user agrees to the terms, a PUT call should be placed containing an array of all the Terms of Service

<aside class="notice">A past due user is subject to suspension of services and may not be allowed to login</aside>

> Request

```shell
curl -X GET https://login.eagleeyenetworks.com/g/user/terms -d "id=[USER_ID]" -H "Authentication: [API_KEY]:" --cookie "auth_key=[AUTH_KEY]" -G
```
