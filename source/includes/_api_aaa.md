## Single Sign On
<!--===================================================================-->

<aside class="success">This service is currently under development and not yet functional</aside>

SSO allows a reseller to maintain account management and act as an identity provider to have their system proxy the authorization requests to Eagle Eye Network servers after users have logged into the identity providers system

This is done through the standard SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and as such the identity provider will setup their account with a **brand_saml_publickey_ret** and **brand_saml_namedid_path**

  - The **brand_saml_publickey_cert** is a x509 certificate that contains a public key with which Eagle Eye Networks can validate that an SSO message is valid and verify that it has not been altered.  The format of this certificate is PEM (ascii encoded base 64 surrounded by lines containing **'-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE——‘** and **'——END CERTIFICATE——'**

  - The **brand_saml_namedid_path** is the xml xpath to the node that contains the email address of the user being logged in

Once the identity provider's account has been registered for SSO, then the identity provider can validate their users and then make a single sign on request with the users email address and the return link
This 64 bit encrypted message will be extracted from the header to be decoded and verified using the saml public key
Then using the saml named ID path, the user's email will be extracted and an `'auth_key'` will be provided for that user
